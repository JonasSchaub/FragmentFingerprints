# FragmentFingerprints
A library to generate fingerprints for molecular structures based on a set of fragments

## Description
The library generates fragment fingerprints based on pre-defined fragments, 
which can be set by the user, and can generate both bit and count fingerprints. 
Fragment fingerprints are created by matching fragments or substructures of a 
molecule with pre-defined fragments. If a match is found, the corresponding positions 
in the fingerprint are filled. The special feature of the fragment fingerprinter is that fingerprints 
are generated exclusively by comparing unique SMILES (Strings). This means that both the pre-defined fragments and 
the substructures or fragments of the molecule for which the fingerprint is 
being generated must be represented as unique SMILES strings. The implementation of the fragment fingerprinter is based on
the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK).

## Contents of this repository
### Sources
The <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/main/src">"src"</a> subfolder contains
all source code packages including JUnit tests.

### Tests
The test class <i>FragmentFingerprinterTest</i> tests the functionalities of fragment fingerprinter.
Among other things, it tests whether the bit and count fingerprint of a molecule has been generated 
correctly. Furthermore, various methods of the CountFingerprint and 
BitSetFingerprint classes are tested.

### Test resources
The test <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/src/test/resources/de/unijena/cheminf/fragment/fingerprint">"resources"</a> subfolder
contains two text files. The text file named "FragmentList.txt" contains all key fragments. And the file 
named "MoleculeList.txt" contains fragments/substructures of molecules. 
In total, 10 molecules with their corresponding fragments are stored in the file.

### Performance Test CMD Application
The folder <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/PerformanceTestCMDApplication">"PerformanceTestCMDApplication</a>
contains the executable JAVA archive <i>FragmentFingerprinter-fat.jar</i>.
It can be executed from the command-line (command: java -jar) to do a performance snapshot of fragment fingerprinter's scaling behaviour for
a growing number of input molecules.
For more details see the file <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/blob/FragmentFingerprint/PerformanceTestCMDApplication/Performance_test_instruction.txt">"Performance_test_instruction.txt"</a>
