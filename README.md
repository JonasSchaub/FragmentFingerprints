# FragmentFingerprints
A library to generate fingerprints for molecular structures based on a set of fragments

## Description
The library generates fragment fingerprints based on pre-defined fragments, 
which can be set by the user, and can generate both bit and count fingerprints. 
Fragment fingerprints are created by matching fragments or substructures of a 
molecule with pre-defined fragments. If a match is found, the corresponding positions 
in the fingerprint are filled. The special feature of the fragment fingerprinter is that fingerprints 
are generated exclusively by comparing unique SMILES (Strings). This means that both the pre-defined fragments and 
the substructures or fragments of the molecule for which the fingerprint is 
being generated must be represented as unique SMILES strings.

## Contents of this repository
### Sources
The <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/main/src">"src"</a> subfolder contains
all source code packages including JUnit tests.

### Tests
The test class <i>FragmentFingerprinterTest</i> tests the functionalities of fragment fingerprinter.
Among other things, it tests whether the bit and count fingerprint of a molecule has been generated 
correctly. Furthermore, various methods of the CountFingerprint and 
BitSetFingerprint classes are tested.

### Test resources
The test <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/src/test/resources/de/unijena/cheminf/fragment/fingerprint">"resources"</a> subfolder
contains two text files. The text file named "FragmentList.txt" contains all key fragments. And the file 
named "MoleculeList.txt" contains fragments/substructures of molecules. 
In total, 10 molecules with their corresponding fragments are stored in the file.

### Performance Test CMD Application
The subfolder <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/PerformanceTestCMDApplication/jar">"jar"</a>
contains the executable JAVA archive <i>FragmentFingerprinter-fat.jar</i>.
It can be executed from the command-line (command: java -jar) to do a performance snapshot of fragment fingerprinter's scaling behaviour for
a growing number of input molecules. It requires four command line arguments: 

* file name of a text file (located in the same directory as the JAR) to read in the key fragments.
  An example file for this can be found in the folder <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/PerformanceTestCMDApplication">"PerformanceTestCMDApplication"</a> 
  under the name <i>FragmentsFile_PerformanceTest_1226.csv</i>.
* file name of a text file (located in the same directory as the JAR) to read in molecules more precisely their fragments.
  An example file for this can be found in the folder <a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/FragmentFingerprints/tree/FragmentFingerprint/PerformanceTestCMDApplication">"PerformanceTestCMDApplication"</a>
  under the name <i>MoleculesFile_PerformanceTest_1226.csv</i>.
* path name for saving the folders with the performance test results.
* integer number that specifies with how many molecules the generation of the fingerprints should start. 
  In each round, the number of molecules to be processed increases by + integer number.

Example usage: <code>java -jar FragmentFingerprinter-fat.jar first-input-file-in-same-dir-name.txt second-input-file-in same-dir-name.txt third-path-name-to-save-results 10</code>
<br>The CMD application will then import the data sets and create bit and count fingerprints. The application will also create output files of the 
measured runtimes and a file in which the generated fingerprints are stored line by line. So that each line 
represents a fingerprint whose components are separated by commas.

## Installation
This is a Gradle project. In order to use the source code for your own software, download or clone the repository and 
open it in a Gradle-supporting IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) as a Gradle project and execute the build.gradle file. 
Gradle will then take care of installing all dependencies. A Java Development Kit (JDK) of version 17 or higher must also
be pre-installed.
