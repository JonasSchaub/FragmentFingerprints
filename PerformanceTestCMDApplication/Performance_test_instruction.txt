PERFORMANCE TEST CMD APPLICATION
---------------------------------
The folder "PerformanceTestCMDApplication"
contains the executable JAVA archive FragmentFingerprinter-fat.jar.
It can be executed from the command line (command: java -jar) to do a performance snapshot of fragment fingerprinter's scaling behaviour for
a growing number of input molecules. It requires four command line arguments: 

* file name of a text file (located in the same directory as the JAR) to read in the key fragments.
  An example file for this can be found in the folder "PerformanceTestCMDApplication"
  under the name FragmentsFile_PerformanceTest.csv
* file name of a text file (located in the same directory as the JAR) to read in molecules or, more precisely, their fragments.
  An example file for this can be found in the folder "PerformanceTestCMDApplication"
  under the name MoleculesFile_PerformanceTest.csv
* path name for saving the folders with the performance test results.
* integer number (bin size) that specifies with how many molecules the generation of the fingerprints should start.
  In each round, the number of molecules to be processed increases by + integer number.

Example usage: java -jar  The CMD application will then import the data sets and create bit and count fingerprints. The application will also create output files of the
measured runtimes and a file in which the generated fingerprints are stored line by line. So that each line 
represents a fingerprint whose components are separated by commas.
